### Day 3
---

#### Day 3: Conditional Probability

    Because we already know that at least one of the children is a boy we reduce the sample space to 
    S = {BB, GB, BG}, we use E as the event in which all children are boys (E = {BB]). The probability is found 
    with the following:
                                            P(E) = |E|/|S| = 1/3.

#### Day 3: Cards of the Same Suit

    As we have already drawn the first card of the specified suit, we will have 12 cards of that suit left, as 
    well as only 51 cards left in the deck. If we draw another card of the same suit we'll have E = 12 and S = 51.
    The probability is calculated with the following:
                                            P(E) = 12/51 = 4/17.

#### Day 3: Drawing Marbles

    Since 1 of the marbles (red) has already been picked we are left with 6 marbles from the
    original 7 of which there are now only 2 red. We now need to retrieve another marble (blue),
    for which we have 4 on the bag. This leaves us with E = 4 and S = 6. The probability is
    calculated with the following:
                                            P(E) = 4/6 = 2/3.
